## Problem description
Developing a social media application which can be used to share information with other people. This application will only be used by people that work in a certain company so they cannot use existing public social media. The application will be an API-only application.

## Scope
1. As a user, I want to save my username, email, and bio description.  
- Authentication and authorization is out of scope of this story and you donâ€™t need to implement them  
2. As a user, I want to post a text that might contain hashtag(s).  
- Maximum limit of a text is 1000 characters  
- A hashtag is a text that is followed by # symbol, for instance: #generasigigih  
3. As a user, I want to see all posts that contain a certain hashtag.  
- A user can only filter by one hashtag name at a time  
4. As a user, I want to see the list of trending hashtags.  
- Trending hashtags are the top 5 most posted hashtags in the past 24 hours  
- A post containing multiple instances of a hashtag only counts as 1 occurrence for trending hashtags calculation  
5. As a user, I want to comment on a post  
- A comment can contain hashtag(s)  
- A hashtag occurrence in a comment is counted in trending hashtags calculation  
6. As a user, I want to attach things to a post  
- Three kinds of attachment are allowed: pictures (jpg, png, gif), video (mp4), and file (any other extensions outside of pictures and videos)

## Notes: reset the Database before running test
mysql -u root < database_reset.sql  
mysql -u root db_generasigigih < database.sql  

## Testing
#### Coverage should be 100% & Postman test should be Passed 100%
rspec --init  
rspec spec/  

## localhost usage
rerun main.rb
